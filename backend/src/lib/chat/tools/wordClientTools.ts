/**
 * Client-executed tools for the Word add-in.
 *
 * The web assistant's tools run in the backend because the documents they
 * touch live in the backend. The active Word document only exists inside the
 * user's Word session, so its tools invert the execution site: the model
 * calls a normal tool, the backend forwards the call to the task pane over
 * the chat's SSE stream (`client_tool_call` frame), the pane executes it with
 * Office.js, and POSTs the result to /word-chat/tool-result. The pending-call
 * bridge below correlates that POST back to the awaiting tool loop, so the
 * model sees real per-edit success/failure instead of a write-only text
 * protocol it can never be corrected on.
 *
 * The bridge is in-memory and therefore single-instance: the POST must reach
 * the same process that is streaming the chat. That matches how the rest of
 * the streaming state (SSE socket, abort signal) already works.
