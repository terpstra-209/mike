/**
 * The review asked for one role vocabulary — Admin, Member, Viewer — and
 * `permissions.test.ts` already fails the build if a user-facing *label* says
 * otherwise. That check cannot see comments, and comments are where the old
 * vocabulary survived: TabularReviewView still explained its gates in terms
 * of "manager+", "non-managers" and "Managers and the owner" long after the
 * tier had been deleted, so the next person to read those gates would learn
 * a ladder the product does not have and reason from it.
 *
 * "Manager" has no legitimate meaning anywhere in this codebase — unlike
 * "owner" (`is_owner`, `owner_email`) and "editor" (text editors), both of
 * which are real, current words. So it is banned outright in the files that
 * describe the permission model, prose included.
 *
 * A deliberate history note escapes by bracketing itself in
 * `[retired-vocabulary] … [/retired-vocabulary]`, which makes "I am
 * describing the model we removed" an explicit claim rather than something a
 * reader has to infer.
